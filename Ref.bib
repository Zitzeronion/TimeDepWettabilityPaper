	abstract = {The basic mechanisms which take place during the displacement of immiscible fluids in porous media have been observed in micromodels and have been modelled. At the pore level, in drainage, the invading fluid chooses the largest throat. In imbibition, the displacement depends on the local geometry. For a large pore-to-throat ratio (aspect ratio), the main mechanism is the collapse of the invading fluid in the smallest channel, without entering the pore. For a small aspect ratio, the wetting fluid invades the pore first, and then the adjacent channels. From observations at the pore level, the author has modelled the displacement on a large scale in some extreme cases by using statistical theories. The different behaviours are then displayed as domains in three phase diagrams: one for drainage and two for imbibition (large and small aspect ratios). At a high rate, when viscous forces are dominant, all the diagrams show a stable domain (described by anti-DLA) and a viscous fingering domain (DLA). In drainage, low capillary numbers lead to capillary fingering represented by invasion percolation. In imbibition, the capillary domain is described either by a compact cluster growth (small aspect ratio) or percolation theory (large aspect ratio). In addition the possibility of flow by film along the roughness of the walls leads to disconnected structures.}

	abstract = {A technique for fabricating micropatterned aluminum surfaces with parallel grooves 30 µm wide and tens of microns in depth is described. Standard photolithographic techniques are used to obtain this precise surface-feature patterning. Positive photoresists, S1813 and AZ4620, are selected to mask the surface, and a mixture of BCl3 and Cl2 gases is used to perform the etching. Experimental data show that a droplet placed on the micro-grooved aluminum surface using a micro-syringe exhibits an increased apparent contact angle, and for droplets condensed on these etched surfaces, more than a 50$\%$ reduction in the volume needed for the onset of droplet sliding is manifest. No chemical surface treatment is necessary to achieve this water repellency; it is accomplished solely by an anisotropic surface morphology that manipulates droplet geometry and creates and exploits discontinuities in the three-phase contact line. These micro-structured surfaces are proposed for use in a broad range of air-cooling applications, where the management of condensate and defrost liquid on the heat transfer surface is essential to the energy-efficient operation of the machine.}

abstract={We study the influence of thermal fluctuations on the dewetting dynamics of thin liquid films. Starting from the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with thermal noise, we derive a fourth-order degenerate parabolic stochastic partial differential equation which includes a conservative, multiplicative noise term---the stochastic thin-film equation. Technically, we rely on a long-wave-approximation and Fokker--Planck-type arguments. We formulate a discretization method and give first numerical evidence for our conjecture that thermal fluctuations are capable of accelerating film rupture and that discrepancies with respect to time-scales between physical experiments and deterministic numerical simulations can be resolved by taking noise effects into account.",

When the volume of the moving upper layer is sufficiently small, the motionless lower layer outcrops over a broad area of the northern wind gyre, and the pattern of separated and isolated western boundary currents agrees with the theory of Veronis (1973). Because planetary geostrophic dynamics omit inertia, lattice Boltzmann solutions of the planetary geostrophic equations do not require a lattice with the high degree of symmetry needed to correctly represent the Reynolds stress. This property gives planetary geostrophic dynamics a significant computational advantage over the primitive equations, especially in three dimensions.},

abstract = {Summary Proper approximation of the force terms, especially the bed slope term, is of crucial importance to simulating shallow water flows in lattice Boltzmann (LB) models. However, there is little discussion on the schemes of adding force terms to LB models for shallow water equations (SWEs). In this study, we evaluate the performance of forcing schemes coupled with different LB models (LABSWE and MLBSWE) in simulating shallow water flows over complex topography and try to find out their intrinsic characteristics and applicability. Three cases are adopted for evaluation, including a stationary case, a one-dimensional tidal wave flow over an irregular bed, and a steady flow over a two-dimensional seamount. The simulating results are compared with analytical solutions or the results produced by the finite difference method. For LABSWE, all the forcing schemes, except for the weighting factor method, fail to produce accurate solutions for the test cases; this is probably due to the mismatch between the bed slope term in source terms and the quadratic depth term of the equilibrium distribution functions in these forcing schemes. For MLBSWE, all the forcing schemes are capable of simulating flows over the complex topography accurately; furthermore, those schemes taking into account the collision effect τ to eliminate the momentum induced by forces provide more accurate solutions with quicker convergence as the lattice size decreases. In this view, MLBSWE can bring more flexibility in treating the force terms and thus can be a better tool to simulate shallow water flows over complex topography in practical application.},

  abstract={We study the stability of a finite-length fluid rivulet at rest on a partially wetting surface. We consider the problem by including the intermolecular force (van der Waals interaction) within the framework of the lubrication approximation. The results are validated by comparison with numerical simulations of the full nonlinear equation. For finite length rivulets, we show that the distance between drops after breakup is very close to the wavelength of maximum growth rate predicted by the linear theory for infinite rivulets. Finally, we compare theoretical and numerical results with reported experimental data.}

Starting with the classical potential flow theory for moving contact surfaces, the discussion extends to various fluid systems describing inhomogeneous, viscous, compressible, and isobaric flows. Thereby an overview on the major stability issues under a broad variety of physical conditions can be given. In particular, the stability analysis is addressed to layered materials in plane and spherical geometries under various dynamical conditions, to inhomogeneous media with variable gradients and different boundary conditions, to viscous boundary layers, compressible atmospheres, and to stationary ablation fronts in laser-driven plasma experiments. The stability theory is further extended to the nonlinear stage of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability and to a discussion of bubble dynamics in two and three dimensions for closed and open bubble domains. For this purpose simple flow models are studied that can describe essential features of bubble rise and bubble growth in buoyancy-driven mixing layers."

It is shown that the drop profiles can be predicted and that this leads to a relation between the edge velocity and the maximum slope, which occurs at an inflection point close to the edge. This relation leads to others governing the variation of drop size and slope with time. The predictions are compared with experiment, using silicone oils, and good agreement obtained. The lubrication approximation theory gives no solution for thicknesses below a value varying from 2 to 9*10-8 m at the drop edge. At thicknesses of this order, or possibly even larger, other effects become important, and some observations on edge behaviour are included.}

abstract = "Experimental results are reported on the spreading of a nonvolatile liquid drop on a horizontal smooth solid surface with negligible effects of gravity and inertia. The liquid is strongly wetting to the solid with an advancing static contact angle θs less than 1°. The drop radius R, the apex height H, and the advancing dynamic contact angle θ were measured as functions of time t. For each drop the data of R-t, H-t, and θ-t follow different power laws, αtβ. The values of α and β for R are close to those predicted by Starov (J. Colloid USSR (Engl. Trans)45(6), 1009 (1983)) for a spreading drop under the action of capillary and viscous forces. But the data for H and θ show less satisfactory agreement with the predictions. For θ two different quantities are measured: θ0 is the angle between the tangent to the drop edge and the solid surface and θRH is the angle calculated from R and H for a spherical drop. The measured θ range from 1.5 to 17°, for capillary number C from 1.8 × 10−6 to 3.3 × 10−4. Correlation by a least-squares fit for the θ-C data gives θ0 = 222C0.353and θRH = 242C0.353 (both in degrees). Good agreement is found between our θ-C data and correlations with those presented in the literature for experiments in a capillary tube (R. L. Hoffman, J. Colloid Interface Sci.50, 228 (1975); T. S. Jiang et al., J. Colloid Interface Sci.69, 74 (1979) and in parallel plate (C. G. Ngan and E. B. Dussan V, J. Fluid Mech.118, 27 (1982)) for a wide range of θ and C. This suggests that, when the capillary and viscous forces are the only dominant factors, θ is independent of the experimental geometry. And hence the correlations can be used to estimate θ when a nonvolatile liquid displaces air with θs < 1° under a dynamically similar condition."

abstract = {SUMMARY In this paper the dynamics of a two-layered liquid, made of two immiscible shallow-layers of different density, has been investigated within the framework of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). The LBM developed in this paper for the two-layered, shallow-water flow has been obtained considering two separate sets of LBM equations, one for each layer. The coupling terms between the two sets have been defined as external forces, acted on one layer by the other. Results obtained from the LBM developed in this paper are compared with numerical results obtained solving the two-layered, shallow-water equations, with experimental and other numerical results published in literature. The results are interesting. First, the numerical results obtained by the LBM and by the shallow-water model can be considered as equivalent. Second, the LBM developed in this paper is able to simulate motion conditions on nonflat topography. Third, the agreement between the LBM (and also shallow-water model) numerical results and the experimental results is good when the evolution of the flow does not depend on the viscosity, that is, during the initial phase of the flow, dominated by gravity and inertia forces. When the viscous forces dominate the evolution of the flow the agreement between numerical and experimental results depends strongly on the viscosity; it is good if the numerical LBM viscosity has the same order of magnitude of the liquid's kinematic viscosity.

In this paper, we introduce the basic principles of the lattice gas method and the lattice Boltzmann method, their numerical implementations and applications to chemically reacting systems. Comparisons of the lattice Boltzmann method with the lattice gas technique and other traditional numerical schemes, including the finite difference scheme and the pseudo-spectral method, for solving the Navier-Stokes hydrodynamic fluid flows will be discussed. Recent developments of the lattice gas and the lattice Boltzmann method and their applications to pattern formation in chemical reaction-diffusion systems, multiphase fluid flows and polymeric dynamics will be presented."

As an example we consider a reactive system modeled by the Brusselator which exhibits Turing structures; the system is subjected to mixing as induced by the wakes behind obstacles. The resulting effect is a modification of the reaction patterns which can be as dramatic as their disappearance."

Then, we discuss further developments: for liquids of low viscosity, it is shown that above a threshold in capillary number, the film is thickened because of inertia. A simple scaling argument is proposed for predicting the location of the threshold."

Despite the excellent barrier properties provided by these materials, all published data show some residual permeation, even when the barrier coatings are relatively thick (≥70 nm). This residual permeation is attributed to the presence of microscopic defects in the coatings. In this article we present new techniques, based mainly on reactive ion etching in oxygen plasma, to render visible micrometer- or sub-micrometer-sized defects in transparent ceramic films on polymers. These techniques can be used to visualize and better understand the origins of defects in these coatings on a microscopic scale, as well as for mapping and counting defect density on a macroscopic scale (tens of cm2 or more)."

However, during the dewetting process of thin liquid films of nanometre thickness the interplay of surface tension γ, substrate potential and thermal noise can lead to qualitatively different behaviour on laterally much larger scales up to microns. By deriving a stochastic thin film equation with a conserved noise term we show that the spectrum of capillary waves changes from an exponential decay to a power law kBT/(γq2) for large wavevectors q due to thermal fluctuations at temperature T. Also the time evolution of film roughness σ(t) and of the typical wavevector k(t) of unstable perturbations changes qualitatively. Whereas a deterministic Navier–Stokes equation in the lubrication approximation predicts in the linear regime a constant k(t) = k0, one finds a coarsening  due to thermal noise.}

The models are obtained as asymptotic limits of the Navier-Stokes equations with the Navier-slip boundary condition for different orders of magnitude for the slip-length parameter. Specifically, the influence of slip on the dewetting behavior of fluids on hydrophobic substrates is investigated here. Matched asymptotics are used to describe the dynamic profiles for dewetting films and comparison is given with computational simulations. The motion of the dewetting front shows transitions from being nearly linear in time for no-slip to t2/3 as the slip is increased. For much larger slip lengths the front motion appears to become linear again. Correspondingly, the dewetting profiles undergo a transition from oscillatory to monotone decay into the uniform film layer for large slip. Increasing the slip further, to very large values, is associated with an increasing degree of asymmetry in the structure of the dewetting ridge profile},

abstract="Thin liquid films are ubiquitous in natural phenomena and technological applications. They have been extensively studied via deterministic hydrodynamic equations, but thermal fluctuations often play a crucial role that needs to be understood. An example of this is dewetting, which involves the rupture of a thin liquid film and the formation of droplets. Such a process is thermally activated and requires fluctuations to be taken into account self-consistently. In this work we present an analytical and numerical study of a stochastic thin-film equation derived from first principles. Following a brief review of the derivation, we scrutinise the behaviour of the equation in the limit of perfectly correlated noise along the wall-normal direction, as opposed to the perfectly uncorrelated limit studied by Gr{\"u}n et al. (J Stat Phys 122(6):1261--1291, 2006). We also present a numerical scheme based on a spectral collocation method, which is then utilised to simulate the stochastic thin-film equation. This scheme seems to be very convenient for numerical studies of the stochastic thin-film equation, since it makes it easier to select the frequency modes of the noise (following the spirit of the long-wave approximation). With our numerical scheme we explore the fluctuating dynamics of the thin film and the behaviour of its free energy in the vicinity of rupture. Finally, we study the effect of the noise intensity on the rupture time, using a large number of sample paths as compared to previous studies.",

  abstract = {Recent years have witnessed tremendous progress and developments of the photoswitchable spiropyran-based polymers, owing to distinctive and particular physicochemical properties of their isomers upon a variety of triggers, and especially light illumination. Light is a fascinating and green stimulus because of its remote control, micron- or submicron-sized focusing area with controllable wavelength and energy, non-invasiveness and non-destructive nature, precisely controlled direction, and availability. In this review, we have emphasized on and summarized the most recent observations and efforts in the progress of photoswitchable spiropyran-based materials and their applications as sensors for heavy metal cations, anions, pH, acid and base vapors, wettability and humidity. Other items include data recording and anticounterfeiting devices, photorheological fluids, optically reversible switching membranes, photoregulating surface plasmon resonance, photomodulation of ion conductivity and mechanoresponsive polymers. The bio-based field is another interesting subject that is discussed here and consists of reversible cell sheet engineering, photodynamic therapy, switchable fluorescence labeling, controlled drug delivery and biological ion channels. On the other hand, limited light penetration inside the living tissues and hazards of high-energy ultraviolet irradiation for initiating photochemical transformations have limited the use of such light-controlled systems in medicinal and therapeutic means. Those spiropyran-based materials which are susceptible to being triggered by low energy near IR (NIR) two-photon light irradiation and upconversion nanoparticles are recently under serious explorations and have been reviewed as a new perspective for their advanced applications.},

abstract = {A method of calculation is introduced that allows the simulation of the time-dependent three-dimensional motion of liquid droplets on solid substrates for systems exhibiting finite equilibrium contact angles. The contact angle is a prescribed function of position on the substrate. An evolution equation is presented, using the lubrication approximation, that includes viscous, capillary, disjoining, and gravitational forces. Motion to and from dry substrate regions is made possible by use of a thin energetically stable wetting layer. Axisymmetric spreading on a uniform substrate is calculated, and it is found, in agreement with reported experiments, that spreading rates are independent of the contact angle until the drop has almost stabilized. We simulate motion on a heterogeneous substrate composed of two different materials having widely different contact angles. Motion proceeds in an almost discontinuous fashion as the initial droplet breaks up into smaller pieces through the action of the wetting forces. Various forms of the disjoining energy functional are employed; the particular choice is found to have only a limited quantitative effect of the drop dynamics. Experimental observations confirm the basic features of the simulation, although a time-scale correction needs to be applied.}

	abstract = {Metallic copper nanoparticles were synthesized by a bottom-up approach, and in situ coated with protective shells of graphene in order to get a metal nanopowder of high air stability and chemical inertness. Using an amphiphilic surfactant, a water-based copper nanocolloid could be prepared and successfully printed onto a polymer substrate by conventional ink-jet printing using household printers. The dried printed patterns exhibited strong metallic gloss and an electrical conductivity of >1 S cm−1 without the need for a sintering or densification step. This conductivity currently limits use in electronics to low current application or shielding and decorative effects. The high stability of graphene-coated copper nanoparticles makes them economically a most attractive alternative to silver or gold nanocolloids, and will strongly facilitate the industrial use of metal nanocolloids in consumer goods.}

Two different sized Ag nanoparticles were used to study the size influence on sintering temperature of the granular metal films. The resistivity variation and microstructure of the Ag films was monitored as a function of temperature using a four-point probe and scanning electron microscopy as well as thermal analysis.}
