	abstract = {The basic mechanisms which take place during the displacement of immiscible fluids in porous media have been observed in micromodels and have been modelled. At the pore level, in drainage, the invading fluid chooses the largest throat. In imbibition, the displacement depends on the local geometry. For a large pore-to-throat ratio (aspect ratio), the main mechanism is the collapse of the invading fluid in the smallest channel, without entering the pore. For a small aspect ratio, the wetting fluid invades the pore first, and then the adjacent channels. From observations at the pore level, the author has modelled the displacement on a large scale in some extreme cases by using statistical theories. The different behaviours are then displayed as domains in three phase diagrams: one for drainage and two for imbibition (large and small aspect ratios). At a high rate, when viscous forces are dominant, all the diagrams show a stable domain (described by anti-DLA) and a viscous fingering domain (DLA). In drainage, low capillary numbers lead to capillary fingering represented by invasion percolation. In imbibition, the capillary domain is described either by a compact cluster growth (small aspect ratio) or percolation theory (large aspect ratio). In addition the possibility of flow by film along the roughness of the walls leads to disconnected structures.}

Standard photolithographic techniques are used to obtain this precise surface-feature patterning. Positive photoresists, S1813 and AZ4620, are selected to mask the surface, and a mixture of BCl3 and Cl2 gases is used to perform the etching. Experimental data show that a droplet placed on the micro-grooved aluminum surface using a micro-syringe exhibits an increased apparent contact angle, and for droplets condensed on these etched surfaces, more than a 50$\%$ reduction in the volume needed for the onset of droplet sliding is manifest. No chemical surface treatment is necessary to achieve this water repellency; it is accomplished solely by an anisotropic surface morphology that manipulates droplet geometry and creates and exploits discontinuities in the three-phase contact line. These micro-structured surfaces are proposed for use in a broad range of air-cooling applications, where the management of condensate and defrost liquid on the heat transfer surface is essential to the energy-efficient operation of the machine.}

abstract={We study the influence of thermal fluctuations on the dewetting dynamics of thin liquid films. Starting from the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with thermal noise, we derive a fourth-order degenerate parabolic stochastic partial differential equation which includes a conservative, multiplicative noise term---the stochastic thin-film equation. Technically, we rely on a long-wave-approximation and Fokker--Planck-type arguments. We formulate a discretization method and give first numerical evidence for our conjecture that thermal fluctuations are capable of accelerating film rupture and that discrepancies with respect to time-scales between physical experiments and deterministic numerical simulations can be resolved by taking noise effects into account.",

When the volume of the moving upper layer is sufficiently small, the motionless lower layer outcrops over a broad area of the northern wind gyre, and the pattern of separated and isolated western boundary currents agrees with the theory of Veronis (1973). Because planetary geostrophic dynamics omit inertia, lattice Boltzmann solutions of the planetary geostrophic equations do not require a lattice with the high degree of symmetry needed to correctly represent the Reynolds stress. This property gives planetary geostrophic dynamics a significant computational advantage over the primitive equations, especially in three dimensions.},

abstract = {Summary Proper approximation of the force terms, especially the bed slope term, is of crucial importance to simulating shallow water flows in lattice Boltzmann (LB) models. However, there is little discussion on the schemes of adding force terms to LB models for shallow water equations (SWEs). In this study, we evaluate the performance of forcing schemes coupled with different LB models (LABSWE and MLBSWE) in simulating shallow water flows over complex topography and try to find out their intrinsic characteristics and applicability. Three cases are adopted for evaluation, including a stationary case, a one-dimensional tidal wave flow over an irregular bed, and a steady flow over a two-dimensional seamount. The simulating results are compared with analytical solutions or the results produced by the finite difference method. For LABSWE, all the forcing schemes, except for the weighting factor method, fail to produce accurate solutions for the test cases; this is probably due to the mismatch between the bed slope term in source terms and the quadratic depth term of the equilibrium distribution functions in these forcing schemes. For MLBSWE, all the forcing schemes are capable of simulating flows over the complex topography accurately; furthermore, those schemes taking into account the collision effect τ to eliminate the momentum induced by forces provide more accurate solutions with quicker convergence as the lattice size decreases. In this view, MLBSWE can bring more flexibility in treating the force terms and thus can be a better tool to simulate shallow water flows over complex topography in practical application.},

	abstract = {Wetting and dewetting are both fundamental modes of motion of liquids on solid surfaces. They are critically important for processes in biology, chemistry, and engineering, such as drying, coating, and lubrication. However, recent progress in wetting, which has led to new fields such as superhydrophobicity and liquid marbles, has not been matched by dewetting. A significant problem has been the inability to study the model system of a uniform film dewetting from a nonwetting surface to a single macroscopic droplet{\textemdash}a barrier that does not exist for the reverse wetting process of a droplet spreading into a film. We report the dewetting of a dielectrophoresis-induced film into a single equilibrium droplet. The emergent picture of the full dewetting dynamics is of an initial regime, where a liquid rim recedes at constant speed and constant dynamic contact angle, followed by a relatively short exponential relaxation of a spherical cap shape. This sharply contrasts with the reverse wetting process, where a spreading droplet follows a smooth sequence of spherical cap shapes. Complementary numerical simulations and a hydrodynamic model reveal a local dewetting mechanism driven by the equilibrium contact angle, where contact line slip dominates the dewetting dynamics. Our conclusions can be used to understand a wide variety of processes involving liquid dewetting, such as drop rebound, condensation, and evaporation. In overcoming the barrier to studying single film-to-droplet dewetting, our results provide new approaches to fluid manipulation and uses of dewetting, such as inducing films of prescribed initial shapes and slip-controlled liquid retraction.},

We consider the problem by including the intermolecular force (van der Waals interaction) within the framework of the lubrication approximation. The results are validated by comparison with numerical simulations of the full nonlinear equation. For finite length rivulets, we show that the distance between drops after breakup is very close to the wavelength of maximum growth rate predicted by the linear theory for infinite rivulets. Finally, we compare theoretical and numerical results with reported experimental data.}

abstract = "The theory of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability of accelerated fluid layers is systematically developed from basic fluid equations. Starting with the classical potential flow theory for moving contact surfaces, the discussion extends to various fluid systems describing inhomogeneous, viscous, compressible, and isobaric flows. Thereby an overview on the major stability issues under a broad variety of physical conditions can be given. In particular, the stability analysis is addressed to layered materials in plane and spherical geometries under various dynamical conditions, to inhomogeneous media with variable gradients and different boundary conditions, to viscous boundary layers, compressible atmospheres, and to stationary ablation fronts in laser-driven plasma experiments. The stability theory is further extended to the nonlinear stage of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability and to a discussion of bubble dynamics in two and three dimensions for closed and open bubble domains. For this purpose simple flow models are studied that can describe essential features of bubble rise and bubble growth in buoyancy-driven mixing layers."

It is shown that the drop profiles can be predicted and that this leads to a relation between the edge velocity and the maximum slope, which occurs at an inflection point close to the edge. This relation leads to others governing the variation of drop size and slope with time. The predictions are compared with experiment, using silicone oils, and good agreement obtained. The lubrication approximation theory gives no solution for thicknesses below a value varying from 2 to 9*10-8 m at the drop edge. At thicknesses of this order, or possibly even larger, other effects become important, and some observations on edge behaviour are included.}

abstract = "Experimental results are reported on the spreading of a nonvolatile liquid drop on a horizontal smooth solid surface with negligible effects of gravity and inertia. The liquid is strongly wetting to the solid with an advancing static contact angle θs less than 1°. The drop radius R, the apex height H, and the advancing dynamic contact angle θ were measured as functions of time t. For each drop the data of R-t, H-t, and θ-t follow different power laws, αtβ. The values of α and β for R are close to those predicted by Starov (J. Colloid USSR (Engl. Trans)45(6), 1009 (1983)) for a spreading drop under the action of capillary and viscous forces. But the data for H and θ show less satisfactory agreement with the predictions. For θ two different quantities are measured: θ0 is the angle between the tangent to the drop edge and the solid surface and θRH is the angle calculated from R and H for a spherical drop. The measured θ range from 1.5 to 17°, for capillary number C from 1.8 × 10−6 to 3.3 × 10−4. Correlation by a least-squares fit for the θ-C data gives θ0 = 222C0.353and θRH = 242C0.353 (both in degrees). Good agreement is found between our θ-C data and correlations with those presented in the literature for experiments in a capillary tube (R. L. Hoffman, J. Colloid Interface Sci.50, 228 (1975); T. S. Jiang et al., J. Colloid Interface Sci.69, 74 (1979) and in parallel plate (C. G. Ngan and E. B. Dussan V, J. Fluid Mech.118, 27 (1982)) for a wide range of θ and C. This suggests that, when the capillary and viscous forces are the only dominant factors, θ is independent of the experimental geometry. And hence the correlations can be used to estimate θ when a nonvolatile liquid displaces air with θs < 1° under a dynamically similar condition."

abstract = {SUMMARY In this paper the dynamics of a two-layered liquid, made of two immiscible shallow-layers of different density, has been investigated within the framework of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). The LBM developed in this paper for the two-layered, shallow-water flow has been obtained considering two separate sets of LBM equations, one for each layer. The coupling terms between the two sets have been defined as external forces, acted on one layer by the other. Results obtained from the LBM developed in this paper are compared with numerical results obtained solving the two-layered, shallow-water equations, with experimental and other numerical results published in literature. The results are interesting. First, the numerical results obtained by the LBM and by the shallow-water model can be considered as equivalent. Second, the LBM developed in this paper is able to simulate motion conditions on nonflat topography. Third, the agreement between the LBM (and also shallow-water model) numerical results and the experimental results is good when the evolution of the flow does not depend on the viscosity, that is, during the initial phase of the flow, dominated by gravity and inertia forces. When the viscous forces dominate the evolution of the flow the agreement between numerical and experimental results depends strongly on the viscosity; it is good if the numerical LBM viscosity has the same order of magnitude of the liquid's kinematic viscosity.

The lattice gas method, regarded as the simplest microscopic and kinetic approach which generates meaningful macroscopic dynamics, is fully parallel and can, as a result, be easily programmed on parallel machines. In this paper, we introduce the basic principles of the lattice gas method and the lattice Boltzmann method, their numerical implementations and applications to chemically reacting systems. Comparisons of the lattice Boltzmann method with the lattice gas technique and other traditional numerical schemes, including the finite difference scheme and the pseudo-spectral method, for solving the Navier-Stokes hydrodynamic fluid flows will be discussed. Recent developments of the lattice gas and the lattice Boltzmann method and their applications to pattern formation in chemical reaction-diffusion systems, multiphase fluid flows and polymeric dynamics will be presented."

Despite the excellent barrier properties provided by these materials, all published data show some residual permeation, even when the barrier coatings are relatively thick (≥70 nm). This residual permeation is attributed to the presence of microscopic defects in the coatings. In this article we present new techniques, based mainly on reactive ion etching in oxygen plasma, to render visible micrometer- or sub-micrometer-sized defects in transparent ceramic films on polymers. These techniques can be used to visualize and better understand the origins of defects in these coatings on a microscopic scale, as well as for mapping and counting defect density on a macroscopic scale (tens of cm2 or more)."

thin liquid films of nanometre thickness the interplay of surface tension
γ, substrate potential and thermal noise can lead to qualitatively different
behaviour on laterally much larger scales up to microns. By deriving a
stochastic thin film equation with a conserved noise term we show that the

kBT/(γq2) for large

σ(t) and of the typical
wavevector k(t) 
of unstable perturbations changes qualitatively. Whereas a deterministic Navier–Stokes
equation in the lubrication approximation predicts in the linear regime a constant
k(t) = k0, one finds a coarsening  due to thermal noise.}

Specifically, the influence of slip on the dewetting behavior of fluids on hydrophobic substrates is investigated here. Matched asymptotics are used to describe the dynamic profiles for dewetting films and comparison is given with computational simulations. The motion of the dewetting front shows transitions from being nearly linear in time for no-slip to t2/3 as the slip is increased. For much larger slip lengths the front motion appears to become linear again. Correspondingly, the dewetting profiles undergo a transition from oscillatory to monotone decay into the uniform film layer for large slip. Increasing the slip further, to very large values, is associated with an increasing degree of asymmetry in the structure of the dewetting ridge profile},

abstract="Thin liquid films are ubiquitous in natural phenomena and technological applications. They have been extensively studied via deterministic hydrodynamic equations, but thermal fluctuations often play a crucial role that needs to be understood. An example of this is dewetting, which involves the rupture of a thin liquid film and the formation of droplets. Such a process is thermally activated and requires fluctuations to be taken into account self-consistently. In this work we present an analytical and numerical study of a stochastic thin-film equation derived from first principles. Following a brief review of the derivation, we scrutinise the behaviour of the equation in the limit of perfectly correlated noise along the wall-normal direction, as opposed to the perfectly uncorrelated limit studied by Gr{\"u}n et al. (J Stat Phys 122(6):1261--1291, 2006). We also present a numerical scheme based on a spectral collocation method, which is then utilised to simulate the stochastic thin-film equation. This scheme seems to be very convenient for numerical studies of the stochastic thin-film equation, since it makes it easier to select the frequency modes of the noise (following the spirit of the long-wave approximation). With our numerical scheme we explore the fluctuating dynamics of the thin film and the behaviour of its free energy in the vicinity of rupture. Finally, we study the effect of the noise intensity on the rupture time, using a large number of sample paths as compared to previous studies.",

The contact angle is a prescribed function of position on the substrate. An evolution equation is presented, using the lubrication approximation, that includes viscous, capillary, disjoining, and gravitational forces. Motion to and from dry substrate regions is made possible by use of a thin energetically stable wetting layer. Axisymmetric spreading on a uniform substrate is calculated, and it is found, in agreement with reported experiments, that spreading rates are independent of the contact angle until the drop has almost stabilized. We simulate motion on a heterogeneous substrate composed of two different materials having widely different contact angles. Motion proceeds in an almost discontinuous fashion as the initial droplet breaks up into smaller pieces through the action of the wetting forces. Various forms of the disjoining energy functional are employed; the particular choice is found to have only a limited quantitative effect of the drop dynamics. Experimental observations confirm the basic features of the simulation, although a time-scale correction needs to be applied.}

Although the importance in this line has not dimmed, other powerful areas have emerged in the last two or three decades. Much more attention has been drawn to light induced motions triggered by photoreactions utilizing molecular and polymer assemblies. Probably, this field is one of the most developing areas in advanced soft material research. This review article mainly deals with azobenzene and diarylethene as the photochroms, and systematically introduces light triggered dynamic processes taking place at interfaces. In terms of the feature size, the systems at interfaces, mesoscopic and microscopic level materials are particularly highlighted. Molecular design and understanding of interfaces are the key to realize smart motility properties in molecular and polymer assemblies. }

When a liquid droplet several millimeters in diameter was placed on a substrate surface modified with a calix[4]resorcinarene derivative having photochromic azobenzene units, asymmetrical photoirradiation caused a gradient in surface free energy due to the photoisomerization of surface azobenzenes, leading to the directional motion of the droplet. The direction and velocity of the motion were tunable by varying the direction and steepness of the gradient in light intensity.
