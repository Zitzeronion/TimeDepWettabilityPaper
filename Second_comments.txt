Second Report of Referee A -- LM17723/Zitz
----------------------------------------------------------------------

With the response given to me by the authors, I think that the
research is probably valid. I still fail to see why I should be very
excited about the findings, so I think that the manuscript would be
better suited for a more specialized journal, like Physical Review E.
The reason for this recommendation is that I can see what the
patterned substrate does, in the sense that the wavelength competes
with that of dewetting. That droplets can mode in a wettability
gradient has also been clear for a long time. I am wondering what is
there to be gained by combining these ideas, and I find the rationale
of the manuscript to be not extremely compelling. In my view, this
would be needed for PRL. I am sorry that I cannot be more positive.

Second Report of Referee B -- LM17723/Zitz
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The authors have responded convincingly to my concerns and addressed
them sufficiently in the revised manuscript. I have also read the
responses to the other reports and I feel that the authors have
addressed these recommendations adequately. In view of this, and my
original favorable assessment, I recommend this manuscript for
publication.

I have just two remarks that are related to concern #5 in my original
report:

1. Most importantly, the authors have added footnote 26, which I find
to be unnecessary, but notice that the curvature has the denominator
to the power of 3/2.

2. The film thickness-dependent surface tension referred to in my
report is not related to the trivial small gradient approximation, and
appears whether the slope is small or large. It is a second order
effect which decays according to d Pi(h) / dh, and could be relevant
for thin films and helpful to address the contact line problem, but
not likely to change the results qualitatively.

ANSWERS: We thank the Referee for clarifying his/her question and we apologize for 
our misunderstanding (we have removed the footnote and the comment on 
the small gradient expansion of the curvature). 
We agree that, when thermal fluctuations are relevant,
it is important to consider the renormalized (i.e., height dependent) surface tension,
especially when it comes to the initial growth of the instability. It is, on the other 
hand, reasonable to expect, as the Referee remarks, that in terms of the dewetting 
morphology (and its relation to the time-dependence of the substrate) the phenomenology
should not be particularly affected, at least qualitatively.
