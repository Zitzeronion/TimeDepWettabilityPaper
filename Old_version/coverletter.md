Dear Editor,

it is our pleasure to submit our manuscript "*Controlling the morphologies of thin liquid film dewetting by model switchable substrates*" as a contribution to Physical Review Letters.

Dewetting of thin liquid films pose an interesting scientific and industrial problem.
From an industrial point of view there are two extremes.
While the process of coating requires the film to be stable, self cleaning devices should dewet as fast as possible.
Theoretically, the problem can be threaded using the thin film equation.
Recently, discoveries of surface treatment paved the way for so called switchable substrates.
The key advantage of these substrates is the control of wettability through external stimuli such as light.
This makes them a perfect candidate for a new generation of open microfluidic devices.
In our work we demonstrate that spatio-temporal varying stimuli on the wettability is sufficient to create novel dewetting states.
We first show by the means of numerical simulations that these stimuli enhance the film stability and provide a scaling argument based on theoretical derivations.
Secondly, by variation of the temporal signal we observe a morphological transition.
The transition can be explained using a dimensionless quantity measuring film retraction and wetting velocities.
To the best of our knowledge this transition and the emerging rivulets have not been observed in dewetting experiments.
We think that our contribution fits the readership of Physical Review Letters since it provides a self contained analysis of a fluid dynamics problem with a high degree of novelty.
Given the reach of Physical Review Letters we hope that experimental groups will take interest in our findings and reproduce them in experiments.

Thank you for your time and consideration. We look forward to hearing from you in connection with our submission.

Yours sincerely,

Stefan Zitz, Andrea Scagliarini and Jens Harting
