  abstract = {In the course of miniaturization of electronic and microfluidic devices, reliable predictions of the stability of ultrathin films have a strategic role for design purposes. Consequently, efficient computational techniques that allow for a direct comparison with experiment become increasingly important. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, that the full complex spatial and temporal evolution of the rupture of ultrathin films can be modelled in quantitative agreement with experiment. We accomplish this by combining highly controlled experiments on different film-rupture patterns with computer simulations using novel numerical schemes for thin-film equations. For the quantitative comparison of the pattern evolution in both experiment and simulation we introduce a novel pattern analysis method based on Minkowski measures. Our results are fundamental for the development of efficient tools capable of describing essential aspects of thin-film flow in technical systems.},

  abstract = {Wetting phenomena are ubiquitous in nature and technology. A solid substrate exposed to the environment is almost invariably covered by a layer of fluid material. In this review, the surface forces that lead to wetting are considered, and the equilibrium surface coverage of a substrate in contact with a drop of liquid. Depending on the nature of the surface forces involved, different scenarios for wetting phase transitions are possible; recent progress allows us to relate the critical exponents directly to the nature of the surface forces which lead to the different wetting scenarios. Thermal fluctuation effects, which can be greatly enhanced for wetting of geometrically or chemically structured substrates, and are much stronger in colloidal suspensions, modify the adsorption singularities. Macroscopic descriptions and microscopic theories have been developed to understand and predict wetting behavior relevant to microfluidics and nanofluidics applications. Then the dynamics of wetting is examined. A drop, placed on a substrate which it wets, spreads out to form a film. Conversely, a nonwetted substrate previously covered by a film dewets upon an appropriate change of system parameters. The hydrodynamics of both wetting and dewetting is influenced by the presence of the three-phase contact line separating ``wet'' regions from those that are either dry or covered by a microscopic film only. Recent theoretical, experimental, and numerical progress in the description of moving contact line dynamics are reviewed, and its relation to the thermodynamics of wetting is explored. In addition, recent progress on rough surfaces is surveyed. The anchoring of contact lines and contact angle hysteresis are explored resulting from surface inhomogeneities. Further, new ways to mold wetting characteristics according to technological constraints are discussed, for example, the use of patterned surfaces, surfactants, or complex fluids.},

We propose the first order kinetic model to describe dynamic contact angles of such adaptive surfaces. The model is general and does not refer to a particular adaptation process. The aim of the proposed model is to provide a quantitative description of adaptive wetting and to link changes in contact angles to microscopic adaptation processes. By introducing exponentially relaxing interfacial energies and applying Young's equation locally, we predict a change of advancing and receding contact angles depending on the velocity of the contact line. Even for perfectly homogeneous and smooth surfaces, a dynamic contact angle hysteresis is obtained. As possible adaptations, we discuss changes and reconstruction of polymer surfaces or monolayers, diffusion and swelling, adsorption of surfactants, replacement of contaminants, reorientation of liquid molecules, or formation of an electric double layer.},

Thin film flows occur over a wide range of length scales and are central to numerous areas of engineering, geophysics, and biophysics; these include nanofluidics and microfluidics, coating flows, intensive processing, lava flows, dynamics of continental ice sheets, tear-film rupture, and surfactant replacement therapy. These flows have attracted considerable attention in the literature, which have resulted in many significant developments in experimental, analytical, and numerical research in this area. These include advances in understanding dewetting, thermocapillary- and surfactant-driven films, falling films and films flowing over structured, compliant, and rapidly rotating substrates, and evaporating films as well as those manipulated via use of electric fields to produce nanoscale patterns. These developments are reviewed in this paper and open problems and exciting research avenues in this thriving area of fluid mechanics are also highlighted.},

They are critically important for processes in biology, chemistry, and engineering, such as drying, coating, and lubrication. However, recent progress in wetting, which has led to new fields such as superhydrophobicity and liquid marbles, has not been matched by dewetting. A significant problem has been the inability to study the model system of a uniform film dewetting from a nonwetting surface to a single macroscopic droplet\textemdash a barrier that does not exist for the reverse wetting process of a droplet spreading into a film. We report the dewetting of a dielectrophoresis-induced film into a single equilibrium droplet. The emergent picture of the full dewetting dynamics is of an initial regime, where a liquid rim recedes at constant speed and constant dynamic contact angle, followed by a relatively short exponential relaxation of a spherical cap shape. This sharply contrasts with the reverse wetting process, where a spreading droplet follows a smooth sequence of spherical cap shapes. Complementary numerical simulations and a hydrodynamic model reveal a local dewetting mechanism driven by the equilibrium contact angle, where contact line slip dominates the dewetting dynamics. Our conclusions can be used to understand a wide variety of processes involving liquid dewetting, such as drop rebound, condensation, and evaporation. In overcoming the barrier to studying single film-to-droplet dewetting, our results provide new approaches to fluid manipulation and uses of dewetting, such as inducing films of prescribed initial shapes and slip-controlled liquid retraction.},

Specifically, we use a lubrication model derived from the Stokes model for strong slippage and linearize the film profile around the flat, unperturbed film. For small slip lengths, we expand the linearized full Stokes model for small slopes up to third order.

Those implementations benefit from a broad range of fabrication methods that are partly adopted from well-established macroscale processes or are completely new and promising. In addition, thin and flexible foils enable various features like low thermal resistance for efficient thermocycling or integration of easily deformable chambers paving the way for new means of on-chip reagent storage or fluid transport. From an economical perspective, Lab-on-a-Foil systems are characterised by low material consumption and often low-cost materials which are attractive for cost-effective high-volume fabrication of self-contained disposable chips. The first part of this review focuses on available materials, fabrication processes and approaches for integration of microfluidic functions including liquid control and transport as well as storage and release of reagents. In the second part, an analysis of the state of Lab-on-a-Foil applications is provided with a special focus on nucleic acid analysis, immunoassays, cell-based assays and home care testing. We conclude that the Lab-on-a-Foil approach is very versatile and significantly expands the toolbox for the development of Lab-on-a-Chip solutions.}

  abstract = {In recent decades novel solid substrates have been designed which change their wettability in response to light or an electrostatic field. Here, we investigate a droplet on substrates with oscillating uniform wettability by varying minimum and maximum contact angles and frequency. To simulate this situation, we use our previous work [Grawitter and Stark, Soft Matter, 2021, 17, 2454], where we implemented the boundary element method in combination with the Cox\textendash Voinov law for the contact-line velocity, to determine the fluid flow inside a droplet. After a transient regime the droplet performs steady oscillations, the amplitude of which decreases with increasing frequency. For slow oscillations our numerical results agree well with the linearized spherical-cap model. They collapse on a master curve when we rescale frequency by a characteristic relaxation time. In contrast, for fast oscillations we observe significant deviations from the master curve. The decay of the susceptibility is weaker and the phase shift between oscillations in wettability and contact angle stays below the predicted {$\pi$}/2. The reason becomes obvious when studying the combined dynamics of droplet height and contact angle. It reveals non-reciprocal shape changes during one oscillation period even at low frequencies due to the induced fluid flow inside the droplet, which are not captured by the spherical-cap model. Similar periodic non-reciprocal shape changes occur at low frequencies when the droplet is placed on an oscillating nonuniform wettability profile with six-fold symmetry. Such profiles are inspired by the light intensity pattern of Laguerre\textendash Gauss laser modes. Since the non-reciprocal shape changes induce fluid circulation, which is controllable from the outside, our findings envisage the design of targeted microfluidic transport of solutes inside the droplet.},

The volume of each drop within a large ``printed'' surface can be tuned by varying base geometry and area with characteristic scales from 5 to 50\,{$\mu$}m. Contrary to macroscopic counterparts, drops with non-Laplacian shapes, i.e. sharp corners, that appears to violate Young-Laplacian relationship locally, are produced. Although the drop relaxes into a spherical cap with constant mean curvature, the contact line with sharp corners remains pinned. Relaxation times from initial to asymptotic shape require extraordinarily long time ({$>$}7 days). We demonstrate that non-Laplacian drops are the direct results of self-pinning of contact line by nanoparticles in the oil. This technique has been applied to study biofilm formation at the oil-water interface and can be readily extended to other colloidal fluids.},

  abstract = {The surface instability, dynamics, morphology, and spontaneous dewetting of a thin liquid film on chemically heterogeneous substrates are studied on the basis of 3D nonlinear simulations. A new mechanism of dewetting in the presence of heterogeneity is proposed where the instability is engendered by the gradient of intermolecular interactions that lead to a microscale wettability contrast. The time scale of instability, which can be several orders smaller than the spinodal dewetting time scale on homogeneous surfaces, varies inversely with the potential difference induced by the heterogeneity. Heterogeneity can even destabilize spinodally stable films, reduce the time of rupture substantially for thicker films, and decrease the dependence of rupture time on the film thickness. The presence of heterogeneity produces complex and locally ordered morphological features that are not predicted by the spinodal dewetting, for example ``ripples'' and ``castle-moat'' structures, radially symmetric structures, and a lack of undulations before the birth of a hole. The precise morphological pattern selection depends on the size of the heterogeneity, the potential difference caused by the heterogeneity, the film thickness, and also the spinodal characteristics of the substrate. The resulting morphologies can be understood on the basis of simple arguments that consider interplay among these factors.},

For large wavelengths and no driving force, within perturbation theory, an analytical expression of the growth rate of pearling instabilities is derived.

By deriving a stochastic thin film equation with a conserved noise term we show that the spectrum of capillary waves changes from an exponential decay to a power law kBT/({$\gamma$}q2) for large wavevectors q due to thermal fluctuations at temperature T. Also the time evolution of film roughness {$\sigma$}(t) and of the typical wavevector k(t) of unstable perturbations changes qualitatively. Whereas a deterministic Navier\textendash Stokes equation in the lubrication approximation predicts in the linear regime a constant k(t) = k0, one finds a coarsening due to thermal noise.}

Here, we discuss two fundamental flaws in the definition of these parameters that significantly affect their interpretation for studies of disordered systems, and offer a remedy. First, the definition of the bond-orientational order parameters considers the geometrical arrangement of a set of nearest neighboring (NN) spheres, NN(p), around a given central particle p; we show that the choice of neighborhood definition can have a bigger influence on both the numerical values and qualitative trend of ql than a change of the physical parameters, such as packing fraction. Second, the discrete nature of neighborhood implies that NN(p) is not a continuous function of the particle coordinates; this discontinuity, inherited by ql, leads to a lack of robustness of the ql as structure metrics.

We studied various fundamental and applied aspects of equilibrium liquid surface morphologies both theoretically and experimentally. Our theoretical analysis showed that surface profiles on homogeneous surfaces display a diverging curvature in the vicinity of the three phase contact line. The asymptotic contact angle at the contact line is equal to Young's angle, independent of the applied voltage. With respect to the morphology of the liquid surface, contact angle variations achieved by electrowetting are equivalent to those achieved by varying the chemical nature of the substrates, except for electric field-induced distortions in a region close to the contact line. Experimentally, we studied the (global) morphology of liquid microstructure substrates with stripe-shaped electrodes. As the local contact angle is reduced by increasing the applied voltage, liquid droplets elongate along the stripe axis as expected. For droplets on a single surface with a stripe electrode, there is a discontinuous morphological transition where elongated droplets transform into translationally invariant cylinder segments with the contact line pinned along the stripe edge and vice versa. If the liquid is confined between two parallel surfaces with parallel stripe electrodes, the elongation of the droplet and its transformation into a translationally invariant morphology with pinned contact lines is continuous. Experimental results are compared to analytical and numerical models.},

Specifically, the influence of slip on the dewetting behavior of fluids on hydrophobic substrates is investigated here. Matched asymptotics are used to describe the dynamic profiles for dewetting films and comparison is given with computational simulations. The motion of the dewetting front shows transitions from being nearly linear in time for no-slip to t2/3 as the slip is increased. For much larger slip lengths the front motion appears to become linear again. Correspondingly, the dewetting profiles undergo a transition from oscillatory to monotone decay into the uniform film layer for large slip. Increasing the slip further, to very large values, is associated with an increasing degree of asymmetry in the structure of the dewetting ridge profile},

Fourier transform analysis of the AFM topographic data at various stages of the film pattern development reveals the presence of quantized surface deformation modes. These modes are excited by the phase separation process when the scale of phase separation becomes commensurate with the period of the striped surface pattern. Thus, higher frequency modes become excited at early stages of phase separation, and these excitations decay with time as the phase separation pattern further coarsens. The film ultimately self-organizes into a periodic structure in which the fundamental mode has the largest amplitude. The influence of film thickness on the film morphology in this late stage is also investigated. A decrease in the film thickness leads to surface patterns that match those of the SAM substrates with increasing resolution. However, these film patterns break up into droplet arrays along the SAM stripes if the films are made too thin. This phenomenon is attributed to a capillary wave instability.},

  abstract = {Macroscopic thin liquid films are entities that are important in biophysics, physics, and engineering, as well as in natural settings. They can be composed of common liquids such as water or oil, rheologically complex materials such as polymers solutions or melts, or complex mixtures of phases or components. When the films are subjected to the action of various mechanical, thermal, or structural factors, they display interesting dynamic phenomena such as wave propagation, wave steepening, and development of chaotic responses. Such films can display rupture phenomena creating holes, spreading of fronts, and the development of fingers. In this review a unified mathematical theory is presented that takes advantage of the disparity of the length scales and is based on the asymptotic procedure of reduction of the full set of governing equations and boundary conditions to a simplified, highly nonlinear, evolution equation or to a set of equations. As a result of this long-wave theory, a mathematical system is obtained that does not have the mathematical complexity of the original free-boundary problem but does preserve many of the important features of its physics. The basics of the long-wave theory are explained. If, in addition, the Reynolds number of the flow is not too large, the analogy with Reynolds's theory of lubrication can be drawn. A general nonlinear evolution equation or equations are then derived and various particular cases are considered. Each case contains a discussion of the linear stability properties of the base-state solutions and of the nonlinear spatiotemporal evolution of the interface (and other scalar variables, such as temperature or solute concentration). The cases reducing to a single highly nonlinear evolution equation are first examined. These include: (a) films with constant interfacial shear stress and constant surface tension, (b) films with constant surface tension and gravity only, (c) films with van der Waals (long-range molecular) forces and constant surface tension only, (d) films with thermocapillarity, surface tension, and body force only, (e) films with temperature-dependent physical properties, (f) evaporating/condensing films, (g) films on a thick substrate, (h) films on a horizontal cylinder, and (i) films on a rotating disc. The dynamics of the films with a spatial dependence of the base-state solution are then studied. These include the examples of nonuniform temperature or heat flux at liquid-solid boundaries. Problems which reduce to a set of nonlinear evolution equations are considered next. Those include (a) the dynamics of free liquid films, (b) bounded films with interfacial viscosity, and (c) dynamics of soluble and insoluble surfactants in bounded and free films. The spreading of drops on a solid surface and moving contact lines, including effects of heat and mass transport and van der Waals attractions, are then addressed. Several related topics such as falling films and sheets and Hele-Shaw flows are also briefly discussed. The results discussed give motivation for the development of careful experiments which can be used to test the theories and exhibit new phenomena.},

This, in turn, initiates a complex dewetting process, which ultimately leads to characteristic droplet patterns. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the type of droplet pattern depends on the specific interfacial condition between the polymer and the substrate. Predicting the morphological evolution over long timescales and on the different length scales involved is a major computational challenge. In this study, a highly adaptive numerical scheme is presented, which allows for following the dewetting process deep into the nonlinear regime of the model equations and captures the complex dynamics, including the shedding of droplets. In addition, our numerical results predict the previously unknown shedding of satellite droplets during the destabilization of liquid ridges that form during the late stages of the dewetting process. While the formation of satellite droplets is well known in the context of elongating fluid filaments and jets, we show here that, for dewetting liquid ridges, this property can be dramatically altered by the interfacial condition between polymer and substrate, namely slip. This work shows how dissipative processes can be used to systematically tune the formation of patterns.},

In this work, a recently developed, coupled phase-field\textendash fluid mechanics framework is used to simulate the BHJ formation upon drying. For the first time, this allows to investigate the interplay between all the relevant physical processes (evaporation, crystal nucleation and growth, liquid demixing, composition-dependent kinetic properties), within a single coherent theoretical framework. Simulations for the model system P3HT-PCBM are presented. The comparison with previously reported in situ characterization of the drying structure is very convincing: The morphology formation pathways, crystallization kinetics, and final morphology are in line with experimental results. The final BHJ morphology is a subtle mixture of pure crystalline donor and acceptor phases, pure and mixed amorphous domains, which depends on the process parameters and material properties. The expected benefit of such an approach is to identify physical design rules for ink formulation and processing conditions to optimize the cell's performance. It could be applied to recent organic material systems in the future.},

Two-photon lithography (TPL)\textendash based submicrometer additive manufacturing is a promising candidate to fill this gap. However, the serial point-by-point writing scheme of TPL is too slow for many applications. Attempts at parallelization either do not have submicrometer resolution or cannot pattern complex structures. We overcome these difficulties by spatially and temporally focusing an ultrafast laser to implement a projection-based layer-by-layer parallelization. This increases the throughput up to three orders of magnitude and expands the geometric design space. We demonstrate this by printing, within single-digit millisecond time scales, nanowires with widths smaller than 175 nanometers over an area one million times larger than the cross-sectional area.},

A great deal of effort has been devoted to improve and advance these devices with the goal of performing complete sets of biochemical assays on the device and possibly developing portable platforms for point of care applications. Among the different microfluidic systems used for such a purpose, digital microfluidics (DMF) shows high flexibility and capability of performing multiplex and parallel biochemical operations, and hence, has been considered as a suitable candidate for lab-on-a-chip applications. In this review, we discuss the most recent advances in the DMF platforms, and evaluate the feasibility of developing multifunctional packages for performing complete sets of processes of biochemical assays, particularly for point-of-care applications. The progress in the development of DMF systems is reviewed from eight different aspects, including device fabrication, basic fluidic operations, automation, manipulation of biological samples, advanced operations, detection, biological applications, and finally, packaging and portability of the DMF devices. Success in developing the lab-on-a-chip DMF devices will be concluded based on the advances achieved in each of these aspects.},

  abstract = {A method of calculation is introduced that allows the simulation of the time-dependent three-dimensional motion of liquid droplets on solid substrates for systems exhibiting finite equilibrium contact angles. The contact angle is a prescribed function of position on the substrate. An evolution equation is presented, using the lubrication approximation, that includes viscous, capillary, disjoining, and gravitational forces. Motion to and from dry substrate regions is made possible by use of a thin energetically stable wetting layer. Axisymmetric spreading on a uniform substrate is calculated, and it is found, in agreement with reported experiments, that spreading rates are independent of the contact angle until the drop has almost stabilized. We simulate motion on a heterogeneous substrate composed of two different materials having widely different contact angles. Motion proceeds in an almost discontinuous fashion as the initial droplet breaks up into smaller pieces through the action of the wetting forces. Various forms of the disjoining energy functional are employed; the particular choice is found to have only a limited quantitative effect of the drop dynamics. Experimental observations confirm the basic features of the simulation, although a time-scale correction needs to be applied.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of thin liquid films on surfaces whose wettability changes in a time-periodic manner are examined in this work. A nonlinear evolution equation based on the lubrication approximation is used to describe the film height, and attractions due to van der Waals forces are incorporated. Film wettability is varied through an imposed sinusoidal modulation of the Hamaker constant. A linear stability analysis predicts that if the mean Hamaker constant is negative, disturbances at the film surface will eventually decay regardless of the amplitude and frequency of the oscillation. However, numerical solution of the evolution equation shows that the film can rupture at a given frequency if the amplitude is sufficiently large. The associated characteristic wavelength can be predicted from results for constant-wettability surfaces if an appropriate effective Hamaker constant is used. For positive mean Hamaker constants, film rupture can be accelerated, delayed, or prevented depending on how the Hamaker constant changes early in the oscillation cycle. The effects of spatial gradients in wettability are also considered, and it is found that oscillation can delay but not prevent rupture. Inclusion of short-range repulsive forces leads to the formation of droplet-like structures separated by ultra-thin films, but this can be prevented by sufficiently large and slow oscillations of the Hamaker constant. The results of this work may find use in applications that make use of surfaces whose wettability can be controlled by external stimuli.},

  abstract = {A theory of the wetting of solids by liquids is put forward. The theory accounts for capillary pressure gradient, gravitational potential gradient, surface tension gradient, disjoining pressure gradient driving forces of flow in thick thin-films and of surface diffusion in thin thin-films. Disjoining pressure stems from the way intermolecular forces aggregate in submicroscopically thin films. For thick thin-films of slowly varying thickness the lubrication approximation to velocity distributions is appropriate. With this approximation the spontaneous, unsteady, two-dimensional spreading of liquid is shown to be governed by a nonlinear convective-diffusion equation for the evolution of the film thickness profile. The predictions of the theory agree with Marmur and Lelah's (1980, 1981) observations of water drops spreading on glass and with Bascom, Cottington and Singleterry's (1964) and Ludviksson and Lightfoot's (1971) observations of oils spreading on high energy surfaces. The theory is used to analyze Derjaguin and co-workers' (1944, 1957, 1970) blowing-off experiments designed to measure thin-film rheology. The theory is also used to buttress the proposition that much contact angle hysteresis is due simply to slow attainment of equilibrium.},

There, liquid absorption into the brush results in swelling of the brush causing changes in the brush topography and wettability. The liquid may also advance within the brush via diffusion (or wicking) resulting in coupled drop and brush dynamics. The specific model accounts for coupled spreading, absorption and wicking dynamics when the underlying energy functional incorporates capillarity, wettability and brush energy. After employing a simple version of such a model to numerically simulate a droplet spreading on a swelling brush we conclude with a discussion of possible model extensions.},

The physics behind the chain of processes comprise the two-way coupling from the electrical to the mechanical domain through the piezoelectric actuator, where an electrical signal is transformed into a mechanical deformation of the printhead structure. The next two steps are the coupling to the acoustic domain inside the ink channels, and the coupling to the fluid dynamic domain, i.e.~the drop formation process. The dynamics of the printhead structure are coupled via the acoustics to the drop formation process in the nozzle. Furthermore, wetting of the nozzle plate and air bubbles can have a negative influence on the printhead performance. The five topics (actuation, channel acoustics, drop formation, wetting, and air bubbles) are reviewed in this paper.

Chemical composition and surface topography are the two key factors in the wettability of solid substrates. Applying external stimuli and exchanging counterions of ionic liquids and polyelectrolyte films are valuable approaches for rendering the change in surface chemistry and/or topography, and for driving the transition between hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of surfaces. Through the combination of stimuli-responsive films and micro-/nanostructural surfaces, smart surfaces with reversible switching between superhydrophobicity and superhydrophilicity have been achieved. As an important advancement in reversibly switchable wettability, this review briefly introduces ionic liquids (ILs) as on\textendash off systems to obtain reversibly switchable wettability and then discusses in more detail the methods to induce the reversibly switchable wettability of surfaces modified by ILs, additives, or thin films. In addition to reversibly switchable wettability mechanisms, open problems and potential solutions are discussed (157 references).}

Thermal fluctuations are shown to be critical to the dynamics of nanoscale films. Compared to the classical instability mechanism, which is driven by disjoining pressure, fluctuations (a) can massively amplify the instability, (b) cause the fluctuation wavelength that is dominant to evolve in time (a single fastest-growing mode does not exist), and (c) decrease the critical wavelength so that classically stable films can be ruptured.},

  abstract = {It has already been asserted, by Mr. Monge and others, that the phenomena of capillary tubes are referable to the cohesive attraction of the superficial particles only of the fluids em\-ployed, and that the surfaces must consequently be formed into curves of the nature of lintearias, which are supposed to be the results of a uniform tension of a surface, resisting the pressure of a fluid, either uniform, or varying according to a given law. Segner, who appears to have been the first that maintained a similar opinion, has shown in what manner the principle may be deduced from the doctrine of attraction, but his demonstration is complicated, and not perfectly satisfactory; and in applying the law to the forms of drops, he has neglected to consider the very material effects of the double curvature, which is evidently the cause of the want of a perfect coinci\-dence of some of his experiments with his theory. Since the time of Segner, little has been done in investigating accurately and in detail the various consequences of the principle. It will perhaps be most agreeable to the experimental phi\-losopher, although less consistent with the strict course of logical argument, to proceed in the first place to the comparison of this theory with the phenomena, and to inquire afterwards for its foundation in the ultimate properties of matter. But it is necessary to premise one observation, which appears to be new, and which is equally consistent with theory and with experiment; that is, that for each combination of a solid and a fluid, there is an appropriate angle of contact between the surfaces of the fluid, exposed to the air, and to the solid. This angle, for glass and water, and in all cases where a solid is perfectly wetted by a fluid, is evanescent: for glass and mer\-cury, it is about 140\textdegree, in common temperatures, and when the mercury is moderately clean.},
